### Important Notes

- Dindo bot use screen pixels to interact with the game client, so it's not a socket bot or even not a MITM bot.
- So, is it detectable by the Anti-bot? > it shouldn't be, because it imitates exactly the human behaviour, but as a conclusion, nothing is 100% safe.
- Just to know: The bot does not encourage multi-boting and does not support it anyway.
- The main goal of this bot is to simplify repetitive tasks and reduce boredom during your game play.
