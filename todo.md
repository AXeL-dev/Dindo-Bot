### TODO

* Use OCR to detect dd number in enclos/inventory
* Add an XP system for dd
* Display global dd stats in log text view or in a widget
* Add option to repeat path
* Manage etable also, instead of enclos & inventory only
* Account management (Connect, Play, Disconnect, Reconnect)
* Job management also, even if the bot is for rearing..
* Use AI for rearing stuff
* Zaap positions are not always the same, so use OCR to detect them maybe? instead of change them for each player

### To Fix

* Game focus (on keypress)
* Windows compatibility
