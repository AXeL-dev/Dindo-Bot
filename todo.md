### TODO

* Use OCR to detect dd number in enclos/inventory
* Add an XP system for dd
* Display global dd stats in log text view or in a widget
* Manage cowshed also, instead of enclos & inventory only
* Add option to switch/change player
* Use AI for rearing stuff
* Zaap positions are not always the same, so use OCR to detect them maybe? instead of change them for each player
* Add treasure hunts management
* Allow user to add more Enclos locations (do the same for Zaap & Zaapi)
